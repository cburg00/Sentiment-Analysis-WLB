Sentiment Analysis App for Work‑Life Balance

A standalone app that helps organizations measure and visualize employee work‑life balance sentiment.

Key features:
- Flexible data sources: load pre‑imported sample data, import any CSV file, or enter free‑form text manually
- Dual analysis modes:
    Text reviews: uses TextBlob to classify each entry as Positive, Neutral, or Negative and computes polarity scores
    Numeric ratings: scales 1–5 work‑life balance scores to a –1 to +1 range and categorizes them into sentiment groups
- Interactive visualizations: pie charts, scatter plots, bar charts and word clouds all with descriptive captions for quick insight
- Automated summary: generates a human‑readable narrative highlighting percentages, averages and recommendations
